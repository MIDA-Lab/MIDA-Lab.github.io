## Updating Website Content

### Group Member Information

To update group member information, follow these steps:

1. **Create/Delete/Modify Member Files**:
   - Member files are located in the `_members/` folder.
   - Each file should be named as `[member name].md` (e.g., `"Matthew K. Roper.md"`).
   - The format for member files is as follows:
     ```yaml
     ---
     name: [Full Name]
     image: images/members/[image-file-name]
     role: [role]
     aliases:
         - [alias1]
         - [alias2]
     links:
         home-page: [homepage URL]
         email: [email address]
     ---
     ```
     - `name` and `role` are required fields, while others are optional.
     - Photos should be placed in the `images/members/` folder.
     - `aliases`: This field is used to link names with publications or blogs. When a member has aliases, the built-in search will include both the full name and all aliases to provide accurate responses.

2. **Add Roles**:
   - To add new roles, edit the `_data/types.yaml` file.

### Editing Pages

To edit specific pages such as blog, contact, projects, research, teaching, or team:

- Navigate to the corresponding folder (e.g., `blog/`, `contact/`, etc.) and edit the `index.md` file.

### Managing Projects

To add, edit, or delete projects:

- Go to the `_data/projects.yaml` file.

### Managing Blogs

To manage blog posts:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `_posts/` folder. The file name should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DD-name.md`.
2. Related images should be placed in the `images/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-name/` folder.
3. When using images in the Markdown file, use absolute links such as:
   ```
   images/posts/YYYY-MM-DD-name/[image-file-name]
   ```

### Updating Citations

To manage citations on the website, follow these steps:

1. **Manually Collected Publications**:
   - The `_data/sources.yaml` file contains manually curated publications.
   - Ensure that this file includes accurate and up-to-date information.

2. **Automatically Fetched Citations**:
   - The `_data/citations.yaml` file stores citations fetched automatically from sources like Google Scholar.
   - **Do not edit this file directly.**
   - Items in `sources.yaml` will override any duplicates found in `citations.yaml`.
   - Note: Automatically fetched citations may contain errors and require manual review.
   - To fetch citations automatically, follow these steps:
     1. Install the required Python dependencies by running:
        ```
        pip install -r _cite/requirements.txt
        ```
     2. Set the `GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_API_KEY` environment variable. You can obtain the API key from [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com).
        ```
        export GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```
     3. Run the citation fetching script:
        ```
        python _cite/cite.py
        ```
     4. Review the fetched citations in `citations.yaml` for accuracy.
     5. Correct any errors and copy the verified items to `sources.yaml`.

3. **Optimal Workflow**:
   - Automatically collect items from Google Scholar and other sources using `python _cite/cite.py`.
   - Review the fetched citations in `citations.yaml` for accuracy.
   - Correct any errors and copy the verified items to `sources.yaml`.

4. **Google Scholar Integration**:
   - The auto-fetch process uses Google Scholar IDs defined in `_data/.google-scholar.yaml`.

5. **Running the Auto Process**:
   - Use the Python scripts in the `_cite/` folder to fetch and process citations.
   - Refer to the script documentation for detailed instructions.

By following this workflow, you can ensure that the website's citations are accurate and up-to-date.
