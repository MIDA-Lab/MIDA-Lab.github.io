We offer courses in deep learning, machine learning, and data science. Our courses are designed to provide students with a solid foundation in the theory and practice of machine learning and deep learning. We also offer courses in data science, which provide students with the skills to analyze and interpret data.

{% include float.html content=img %}

**Total Credits**: 3 ; **Time**: Every Fall

**Course Objectives**: This course is designed to provide math foundation for many higher-level courses, such as advanced data mining, pattern recognition, statistic learning and computer vision. It will concentrate on presenting the fundamental theories of optimization and developing the ability to recognize and solve optimization problems in data analysis. Selected topics are: convex sets and functions; linear programming (LP), Quadratic programming (QP) and semi-definite programming (SDP); duality theory; interior-point methods; and data analysis applications.

**Textbook**: Convex Optimization, Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe, Cambridge University Press, 2004. http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/

**Prerequisites**: Strong working knowledge of linear algebra and a programming language (R, Matlab, C++, Python, etc.)

  {% include figure.html image="images/dip_book.jpg" width="320px" %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include float.html content=img flip=true %}

**Total Credits**: 3 ; **Time**: Every Summer

**Course Objectives**: Digital image processing (DIP) focuses on two major tasks: improving image information for human interpretation and processing image data for storage, transmission, representation for autonomous machine perception. DIP techniques are used extensively in many applications such as self-driving, industrial inspection, artistic effects, medicine, geographic information systems, and law enforcement. This course aims to introduce digital image fundamentals and discuss the key techniques of image enhancement, morphological processing, image segmentation, object recognition, and image representation.
